# Usage
This application is for afk botting Tom Clancy's Ranbo Six: Siege. The main purpose is to farm levels and renown, or to improve reputation (yes, improve).
It currently will get your reputation to 'disruptive' (the second lowest), with no text/voice abuse or friendly fire and a maxed out griefing bar.
Griefing currently has no in-game penalties, unlike the others, so it's useful for clearing out your penalties without actually having to play the game.

It looks on the screen for in-game buttons, namely buttons to start queue or find another game. It compares the images in the 'assets' folder with regions of the screen.
It clicks 'ok' on pop-ups, like the common 'connection to server failed' lmao. It also commends teammates when the game ends.
It presses '5' repeatedly to not get kicked for inactivity. I have plans to add movement later, but for now that's all it does.
It won't send keypresses if "Rainbow Six" isn't the current window, so you can safely alt-tab around with the bot running, and if the game crashes, it won't
do anything with other open applications or the desktop.

You can either run the compiled exe in releases, or you can download the source code, install python and the necessary packages.
Run afk.py if you choose to use the source code.

Press F2 to start/stop the bot.
